## Description

- FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE APPLICATION

  This project is a **currency converter web application** built using **Streamlit** in Python. It integrates with the open-source [Frankfurter API](https://frankfurter.dev/), which provides users with real-time and historical exchange rate data. This application helps users:

1. **Convert between any two supported currencies** by entering an amount and selecting the source and target currency codes.
2. **Fetch the latest conversion rates**, along with the calculated converted amount and the inverse rate for transparency.
3. **Retrieve historical rates** by selecting a specific date from a calendar input, giving users the ability to review past conversion values.
4. **Visualize long-term trends** in exchange rates by selecting a number of years, after which the app plots a quarterly trend line chart for the chosen currency pair.

The goal of the app is to make foreign exchange information easily accessible in a clean, interactive, and user-friendly way without needing to query APIs directly.

- CHALLENGES FACED

1. Handling API errors gracefully when data was unavailable or the request failed.
2. Formatting the output consistently to match the assignmentâ€™s requirement.
3. Ensuring Streamlit widgets worked together using `st.session_state`.
4. Converting quarterly dates into a trend chart with consistent ordering.

- FUTURE WORKS

1. Add support for multiple target currencies at once.
2. Allow exporting conversion history as CSV.
3. Implement caching for API calls to reduce network requests.

## How to Setup

- STEPS TO SET-UP

1. **Clone or download** the project zip file and extract the contents.

   ```bash
   dsp_at2_25548684.zip
   ```

   Alternatively, **clone the [GITHUB REPO](https://github.com/Sidsuresh/Currency_Converter)**.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sidsuresh/Currency_Converter.git
   ```

2. **Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or your preferred IDE.
3. **Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**, above version 3.10. Python version 3.12.3 was used for this project.
4. **Install the required packages**

```bash
   a. streamlit==1.36.0  # Provides an easy way to build interactive web apps for data visualization and machine learning projects.
   b. pandas==2.2.2 # Offers powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and handling tabular datasets.
   c. requests==2.32.3 # Simplifies making HTTP requests to APIs and retrieving data from the web.
```

## How to Run the Program

1. **Open your preferred terminal** and **navigate to the project folder**
2. **Run the streamlit server**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local Streamlit server (usually on http://localhost:8501) and open the app in your browser.

### Example Usage

1. Enter an amount (e.g., 100).
2. Select a from currency (AUD) and a to currency (BGN).
3. Click "Get Latest Rate" to see

```bash
The conversion rate on 2025-09-29 from AUD to BGN was 1.0951. So, 1.0 in AUD corresponds to 1.0951 in BGN. The inverse rate is 0.9132.
```

4. Use the date picker to select a past date and fetch historical rates.
5. Use the slider to view a quarterly trend over the last N years (line chart).

## Project Structure

The files present in this project include:

```bash
app.py           # Main Streamlit app handling UI and user inputs
api.py           # Helper functions for making HTTP requests to the Frankfurter API
frankfurter.py   # Functions to fetch currency list, latest rate, historical rates, and rate trends
currency.py      # Utility functions: rounding rates, inverse rate, formatting output text
README.md        # Project documentation
```
